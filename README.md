All objectives that must be met, mark as completed once finished.

1. A homepage that has hyperlinks to business/ company information, news releases, FAQ, login 
and  new  user  registration,  product  catalog,  shopping  cart,  order  confirmation,  and  order 
retrieval.

2. A business background page that include details about business, mission, and executive board 
members. [ABOUT US PAGE, CARLY]

3. Details on business policies including cost of your products and/ or services provided by your 
business; shipping policy and rates; tax policy; and return of merchandize policy. [POLICIES PAGE, SEBASTIAN - finished the layout need to figure out where to place it and update the background to match the rest of the website.]

4. In  the  FAQ  page,  create  at  least  10  questions  and  answers  regarding  the  company,  products, 
ordering, and registration. The questions should be listed at the top of the page and each question 
if possible, should have hyperlink to the corresponding answer within the document. If you are not 
providing hyperlink then it can be a plain document having questions and answers. [FAQ PAGE, SEBASTIAN]

5. In the products/services catalog page, display list of products/services and allow user to view 
or  search  products/services  based  on  a  combination  of  attributes  (for  e.g.,  name,  category, 
price, color, etc.). [PARTIALLY COMPLETE, NEEDS SEARCH]

6. From the list of products/services displayed, users should be able to add the products/services 
to a shopping cart. [COMPLETED, DEFAULT]

7. The  shopping  cart  page  should  show  all  the  items  selected  for  purchase,  calculate  the  total 
including taxes and shipping, and provide a link to confirm the order and make payment. The 
payment  page  should  collect  the  user’s  full  name  and  credit  card  details  to  complete  the 
transaction. For this project, there is no need to implement any payment processing with actual 
credit card companies. [COMPLETED, NIC]

8. When the transaction is complete, show an order confirmation page. The order confirmation 
page must store the order details in a database to be retrieved any time by the user. Once the 
order is confirmed, the shopping cart should be emptied. [MAYBE?]

9. Users should be able to login and retrieve order information by providing order #.

10. First time users who purchase products or sell products should be required to register with a 
unique  username  and  password.  During  registration,  collect  information  about  the  user, 
including first name, last name, address, daytime phone, email, and other relevant information 
for the web site. Only registered users can buy or sell from the web site. 
Point 10 is optional as many companies don’t do registration
